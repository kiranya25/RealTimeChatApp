2. Strategy Pattern
Use Case: A payment processing system where the user can choose different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, and Bitcoin).
Creational Design Patterns
1. Singleton Pattern
Use Case: A logging system where only one instance of the logger should be used throughout the application.
2. Factory Method Pattern
Use Case: A document editor that can create different types of documents (e.g., Word, Excel, and PDF).
Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern
Use Case: An old media player that can play audio files, but we need it to play video files as well using a new video player.
2. Decorator Pattern
Use Case: A text editor that can add various functionalities (e.g., spell check, grammar check, and auto-completion) to a basic text editor.
